> A hardware-based Digital Clock built using discrete ICs without a microcontroller.

---

## 📌 Overview
A digital clock designed entirely using digital electronics. The project demonstrates the fundamentals of counters, clock division, sequential logic, and seven-segment display interfacing without relying on programmable devices such as Arduino or ESP32.

The clock displays time in **24-hour format (HH:MM:SS)** and includes **AM/PM indication** using LEDs.

This project is intended for educational purposes to strengthen understanding of Digital Electronics and Hardware Design.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. A clock pulse is generated using an Timer 555 IC.
2. The pulse is converted into a precise 1 Hz signal.
3. CD4026BE ICs count the pulses and converts BCD to a seven-segment display signals.
4. Counter carry outputs cascade into the next digit.
5. Logic resets counters at appropriate values:
   - Seconds: **59 → 00**
   - Minutes: **59 → 00**
   - Hours: **12 → 01**
